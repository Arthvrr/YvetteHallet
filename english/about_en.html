            <h2>About Yvette Hallet</h2>

            <p>
                It is with complete artistic freedom that <strong>Yvette HALLET</strong>, a Belgian painter, creates colorful works on recycled cardboard — her favorite medium for the past five years. She loves cardboard for its texture, its satin finish, its “worn skin” appearance that has lived and already tells a story... She also paints on canvas, plexiglass, and wood.
            </p>

            <p>
                The artist enjoys painting still lifes, as if to bring them back to life. She is also inspired by the social issue of migration, which, according to her, allows her to add a touch of gentleness to her pictorial creativity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each of her works tells a story. Through them, Yvette expresses her joy, her anger, all with vivid colors — especially red — as well as beautiful colored grays she creates herself. Yvette HALLET began painting with ink, then moved on to acrylic and later to oil. Her cardboard pieces are painted exclusively with oil, and she carefully varnishes the exposed areas. Plexiglass, on the other hand, requires a different technique — she must paint in immediacy, as acrylic dries quickly. The gesture becomes imperfect, even clumsy, with no room for correction — a result she appreciates.
            </p>

            <p>
                The artist, imbued with great freedom, allows herself a lot of originality in her work, which she also creates on commission.

            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>
                She has been drawing since early childhood, but without parental approval to pursue fine arts, Y. Hallet became a schoolteacher in her village. Her determination led her, in 1992, to attend evening classes for three years at IRAM (St-Luc) in Mons.

            <p>
                Yvette experiments, reshapes, and dares to use mixed techniques — from tempera to ballpoint pen, including ink, wax, acrylic, and oil. She is drawn to materials such as paper, canvas, wood, aluminum, plexiglass, and cardboard.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2000, Yvette joined the Academy of Fine Arts in Namur, where she practiced sculpture for five years. At the same time, she enrolled in a painting workshop in Beauraing, and since 2021, she has been sharing her experience with other participants.
            </p>
            <p>
                She has attended numerous painting workshops in France, Italy, Spain, and Greece. She received awards in 1987, 1998, 2003, 2011, 2013, and 2018. Since the Covid pandemic, Yvette has been exhibiting exclusively in her home, which has become her own gallery, <strong>CHEV'HALLET</strong>, and for several years she has also exhibited at the <em>International Contemporary Art Fair</em> in London.
